## Development

There are various strategies for migrating from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. One such strategy is called strangulation, which involves gradually replacing parts of the monolith with microservices over time. This can be done by identifying functional areas of the monolith and breaking them out into separate microservices, which can then be integrated with the rest of the system. It's important to carefully plan and test any migration strategy to ensure that it's done smoothly and without disrupting the overall functionality of the system. Additionally, it's important to consider the trade-offs between monolithic and microservices architectures, as each has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific needs of the application.

## Cloud Native

The architecture of rapd.cloud aims to provide a cloud native development environment that delivers high availability, scalability, resilience, and observability for containerized applications deployed on Kubernetes clusters. This includes using multiple replicas of applications running in a Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling enabled and a load balancer to achieve high availability, horizontal pod autoscaling to achieve scalability, redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components to achieve resilience, and logging, monitoring, and tracing for observability. Additionally, regular backups and disaster recovery plans are in place to minimize downtime and data loss in case of a disaster or outage.
